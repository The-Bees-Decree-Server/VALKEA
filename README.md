Hildir

   

#### 300+ Brand Spanking New Build Pieces for a more upbeat homestead.  

 
  <h6> 
  
**VALKEA** offers everything ranging from kitchen wares, buildable foods for a better pantry, window coverings, domestic goods, new stones,
suspension bridges, spiral stair cases, new hives and an ENTIRE collection of LIGHT SHEAWOOD to build a brighter more upbeat homestead!
Many items are spread across different hammer tabs in order for all pieces to be avalaible without the need for an external page/hammer mod for them to been present. Ie: Glass in Crafting > Building.
   


All pieces are found in a dedicated "hammer", *BJORKSNAS*.  

*BJORKSNAS* takes FineWood, QueenBee and 999 Coins to craft. 
Hammer recipe can be locked/adjusted via SERVER SYNC config.
